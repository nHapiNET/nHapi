# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Upcoming Release

## [3.X.X] - TBC

## Previous Releases

## [3.2.4] - 2025-04-09

If you reference the single nHapi nuget metapackage then this release is purely superficial and does not add anything, if you reference individual nHapi model packages then this brings you the same fix as the previous release.

### Other

- Updates individual model nuget packages to depend on the `nhapi.base` `3.2.3` which contains the transitive dependency security vulnerability fix
- Removes direct reference to `nhapi.base` form the nHapi metapackage as there is already a transitive reference from the `nhapi.model.*` dependencies.

By @milkshakeuk

## [3.2.3] - 2025-04-07

This release fixes a security vulnerability with a transitive dependency.

### Other

- [#678](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/issues/678) Update `System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager` dependency for `netstandard2.0` target framework to `8.0.1` to fix [transitive dependency vulnerability](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rxg9-xrhp-64gj).

By @milkshakeuk

## [3.2.2] - 2023-01-24

This release is purely superficial, it does not fix or add anything.

- Add appropriate [target framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/target-frameworks) metadata to the metapackage nuspec - already exists in the individual nuget packages.

See [3.2.0](#320---2023-01-20) release for latest changes.

By @milkshakeuk

## [3.2.0] - 2023-01-20

Various new `ParserOptions` have been added, see the [wiki](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/wiki/Parser-Options) for more information.

### Things of note

As part of [#398](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/pull/398) the imperfect behaviour of `XmlParser` and `DefaultXmlParser` have been updated and brought inline with `hapi` fixing many quirks and defects. If you are dependant on this old behaviour you can use `LegacyXmlParser` and `LegacyDefaultXmlParser` instead, these will be available until the next major version of `nHapi`.

The [nHapi](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nhapi) convenience nuget package is now a meta package meaning it does not directly contain any Dlls. This metapackage just describes its dependencies, which happen to be all of the individual nHapi nuget packages. If you want to understand a little bit more about metapackages [read this](https://andrewlock.net/what-is-the-microsoft-aspnetcore-metapackage/).

There is no difference in behaviour when using this metapackage vs the previous nHapi nuget package.

### Bug Fixes

- [#256](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/pull/256) Simplify cspoj through use of props and targets files. By @milkshakeuk
- Update tools and build to net6.0. By @milkshakeuk

## [3.0.4] - 2021-08-11

This change is to prevent the following Exception:

> System.ArgumentException - An item with the same key has already been added.

In cases where dictionaries / hashtables are used for lookups such as `Escape.cs` when there multiple threads trying to add to them at the same time.

Instead of using `Add(key, value)` which only allows 1 items with a given key to be added to the dictionary / hashtable, we are using the index accessor to set or update the value in a last one wins scenario, but only when its combined with `ContainsKey` which has indicated that an item with that key shouldn't exist.

By @milkshakeuk

## [3.0.3] - 2021-08-10

This change updates the `PipeParser` Version check when obtaining encoding characters from a message object in order to encode it to HL7; `string.CompareOrdinal` is now used instead of `System.Version` which is more forgiving when a version contains non numerical characters.

By @milkshakeuk

## [3.0.2] - 2021-08-09

This change gives nhapi [strong-named assemblies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/strong-named), there are no codes changes.

### Bug Fixes

- [#227](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/issues/227) fixes "A strongly-named assembly is required" runtime errors

By @milkshakeuk

## [nhapi.model.v231 3.0.1] - 2021-07-02

This release is for the NuGet package `nhapi.model.v231` only, there are no code changes, see below for change.

- Remove unused project reference.

## [3.0.0] - 2021-06-28

Along with the changes below you can now be more selective about how you install nHapi, please read the [Getting Started](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/wiki/Getting-Started#nhapi-version-300) page of the wiki for more information.

### Breaking Changes

Default escape sequence for carriage return has changed from `\X000d\` to `\X0D\` which brings it inline with other libraries and [InterSystems ensemble](https://docs.intersystems.com/latest/csp/docbook/Doc.View.cls?KEY=EHL72_escape_sequences).

However if you rely on the old escape sequence of `\X000d\` for carriage returns you can now configure this, see [#185](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/pull/185) or the [wiki](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/wiki/Configuration-Options) for configuration options.

The latest `PipeParser` implementation from hapi has been ported over to nHapi, there aren't any breaking changes that I am aware of, only benefits, however if you relied on the specific behaviour of the old `PipeParser.cs` then you can use `LegacyPipeParser.cs` instead, which is the old implementation.
