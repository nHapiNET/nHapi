## Previous Releases
###

## [3.0.4] - 2021-08-11
This change is to prevent the following Exception:

> System.ArgumentException - An item with the same key has already been added.

In cases where dictionaries / hashtables are used for lookups such as `Escape.cs` when there multiple threads trying to add to them at the same time.

Instead of using `Add(key, value)` which only allows 1 items with a given key to be added to the dictionary / hashtable, we are using the index accessor to set or update the value in a last one wins scenario, but only when its combined with `ContainsKey` which has indicated that an item with that key shouldn't exist.
## [3.0.3] - 2021-08-10
This change updates the `PipeParser` Version check when obtaining encoding characters from a message object in order to encode it to HL7; `string.CompareOrdinal` is now used instead of `System.Version` which is more forgiving when a version contains non numerical characters.

## [3.0.2] - 2021-08-09
This change gives nhapi [strong-named assemblies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/strong-named), there are no codes changes.
### Bug Fixes
- [#227](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/issues/227) fixes "A strongly-named assembly is required" runtime errors

## [nhapi.model.v231 3.0.1] - 2021-07-02
This release is for the NuGet package `nhapi.model.v231` only, there are no code changes, see below for change.

- Remove unused project reference.

## [3.0.0] - 2021-06-28
Along with the changes below you can now be more selective about how you install nHapi, please read the [Getting Started](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/wiki/Getting-Started#nhapi-version-300) page of the wiki for more information.

### Breaking Changes
Default escape sequence for carriage return has changed from `\X000d\` to `\X0D\` which brings it inline with other libraries and [InterSystems ensemble](https://docs.intersystems.com/latest/csp/docbook/Doc.View.cls?KEY=EHL72_escape_sequences).

However if you rely on the old escape sequence of `\X000d\` for carriage returns you can now configure this, see [#185](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/pull/185) or the [wiki](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi/wiki/Configuration-Options) for configuration options.

The latest `PipeParser` implementation from hapi has been ported over to nHapi, there aren't any breaking changes that I am aware of, only benefits, however if you relied on the specific behaviour of the old `PipeParser.cs` then you can use `LegacyPipeParser.cs` instead, which is the old implementation.
